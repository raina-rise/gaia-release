# Problem Solved

## 1. Solving the Performance Issues of Loading Large Images
- **Problem**: Directly loading high-resolution images (such as satellite maps, medical imaging, CAD drawings) can consume a lot of memory, causing the browser to lag or crash.
- **Solution**: Split the large image into smaller tiles and load only the necessary parts as needed, instead of loading the entire image at once.
This approach reduces the initial rendering time and allows progressive loading of high-definition content.

## 2. Solving the Clarity Issues During Zooming
- **Problem**: Zooming directly on a large image may result in blurriness, aliasing, or lag, negatively affecting the visual experience.
- **Solution**: Use tiles with different resolutions (multi-level pyramid structure): low-resolution tiles for zooming out to improve performance, and high-resolution tiles for zooming in to maintain clarity. This allows for lossless zooming and avoids distortion or lag caused by directly scaling the large image.

## 3. Solving Scroll and Viewport Optimization Issues
- **Problem**: Loading the entire large image causes severe repainting, frame drops, or lag during panning (dragging) or zooming.
- **Solution**: Only load the tiles within the current viewport. Do not render the parts outside the viewport to avoid unnecessary calculations.
